🔧 Your Goal
Learn AI/LLM by building a real-world, open-source project that helps users interact with multiple LLM providers.
🧠 Your Core Idea
An app that lets users:
Store API keys for multiple LLM providers (BYOK model)
Query any supported LLM from a single interface
Track token usage and estimated cost
(Optional) Route queries intelligently based on cost/performance
Save and organize query history and responses
🧪 Motivation
Hands-on learning with LLM APIs, key security, Firestore, and deployment
Useful tool for the community: could be open-source and self-hostable
No monetization at first, focus is on learning and sharing
Inspired by tools like OpenRouter.ai, LLM Gateway, and Veloera
✅ Use Cases (User Stories)
As a user, I should be able to store API keys securely for multiple LLMs
As a user, I should be able to select a provider and send a prompt
As a user, I should see token usage and estimated cost after a query
As a user, I should be able to delete or update API keys
As a user, I should be able to view my query history
As a user, I want this app to be open-source and transparent
🔁 Options Considered
Option	Pros	Cons
React-based app	Modern UI, smooth interactions	Heavier, needs backend to proxy API calls securely
Flask-only app	Simpler, lighter, easier to deploy on GCP	Less interactive UI, but faster to build and secure
Flask + React	Best of both (modern UI + secure backend)	More complex to manage and deploy
You chose to start with a Flask-based app, integrated with Firestore, and hosted on GCP Cloud Run — because it’s lightweight, secure, and easy to iterate.
🧱 Architecture
User Browser
   ↓
Flask App on Cloud Run
   ├── HTML UI (Jinja templates)
   ├── Manages API keys (stored encrypted in Firestore)
   ├── Sends user prompts to selected LLM APIs
   └── Tracks usage, history, and cost (stored in Firestore)

Firestore
   ├── Users/{userId}/api_keys/{provider}
   ├── Users/{userId}/history/{entry}
📅 Learning-Focused Project Plan
Week-by-week:
Flask app setup, HTML templates, secure form handling
Firestore integration, API key CRUD (with encryption)
Query interface to send prompts to OpenAI / Anthropic, show responses
Track token usage, estimate cost, save history
UI improvements, error handling, history UI
Write README, license, docs; open-source it
You can later:
Add query routing
Support more LLMs
Add optional login (e.g., Firebase Auth)
🔐 Security
API keys encrypted using Python cryptography.fernet
Keys stored in Firestore, one per provider
All prompt handling is server-side (no keys exposed in browser)
On Cloud Run, you don’t need GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS — GCP uses Application Default Credentials (ADC) automatically
📦 Deployment (planned)
Use GCP Cloud Run to host the app
Store data in Firestore (Native Mode)
No frontend build needed — server-rendered UI with Jinja2
Minimal setup: just a Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and gcloud deploy
🧰 You also received:
✅ A working Flask + Firestore + Jinja2 starter code
✅ Example of secure API key storage (with encryption)
✅ Instructions for setting up IAM roles
✅ Draft README.md for GitHub
✅ A full learning path with tasks, resources, and next steps
🚀 Your Next Actions
✅ Create a GitHub repo
✅ Add your README and starter Flask code
🔜 Set up your GCP project: Firestore, Cloud Run, IAM roles
🔜 Deploy the app (I can help you with Docker + gcloud run deploy)
🔜 Start extending features: prompt sending, cost tracking, history, etc.
🔜 Invite feedback and contributors!
