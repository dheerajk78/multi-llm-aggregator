Learning-Focused Project Plan: Open-Source Multi-LLM Aggregator
Phase 1: Foundations & MVP (2–3 weeks)
Goals:
  a. Understand LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and their usage models
  b. Build a simple React app to manage API keys locally (BYOK)
  c. Implement querying a single provider and showing responses
Tasks:
  a. Research & document API key generation and usage for 1-2 providers
  b. Build API Key Manager UI (add/view/delete keys, localStorage)
  c. Build Query Interface for single provider
  d. Test and debug requests, handle errors gracefully
Learning outcomes:
  a. Basic React development
  b. Working with REST APIs and async data fetching
  c. API key security basics

Phase 2: Multi-Provider Support & Cost Tracking (3–4 weeks)
Goals:
  a. Extend to multiple providers with provider selection
  b. Add token usage and cost estimation per query
  c. Improve UI/UX for seamless provider switching
Tasks:
  a. Wrap multiple API clients with unified interface
  b. Show usage stats and cost estimates (using provider pricing docs)
  c. Save query history locally and allow favorites
  d. Handle edge cases: rate limits, errors, invalid keys
Learning outcomes:
  a. Managing state and data in React with complex UI
  b. Understanding token-based billing and pricing models
  c. More advanced error handling and UX design

Phase 3: Security, Documentation & Community (2–3 weeks)
Goals:
  a. Add encryption for API keys (client-side or optional backend)
  b. Write clear user & contributor documentation
  c. Open-source project launch: GitHub repo, README, issues
Tasks:
  a. Research lightweight encryption libraries for browser/local storage
  b. Write onboarding and security best practices docs
  c. Prepare contribution guidelines and code of conduct
  d. Promote project on AI/open-source forums
Learning outcomes:
  a. Security best practices in client apps
  b. Open-source collaboration basics
  c. Community engagement and project management

Optional Phase 4: Advanced Features & Integrations
  a. Auto-routing queries based on cost or latency
  b. Multi-device sync (optional backend)
  c. Plugin system for new providers or custom workflows
  d. Dashboard with analytics & usage trends

Week-by-Week Task Checklist for Your Multi-LLM Aggregator
Week 1: Foundations
 Research and understand API key creation for OpenAI and Anthropic
 Set up a new React project (e.g., using Vite or Create React App)
 Build API Key Manager UI (add/view/delete keys stored in localStorage)
 Test storing and retrieving keys securely (basic)
 Document your learnings and setup steps
Week 2: Single Provider Query
 Build a simple query interface that sends prompts to one LLM provider using stored API key
 Display response results in the UI
 Add error handling (invalid keys, network errors)
 Write small tests to verify API calls
 Document API usage and how to add keys
Week 3: Multi-Provider Support
 Extend API Key Manager to support multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
 Build unified query interface allowing provider selection
 Implement request routing based on selected provider
 Test sending requests to multiple providers separately
 Improve UI to handle multiple responses
Week 4: Cost & Usage Tracking
 Research pricing models for each provider (tokens, requests)
 Implement token usage calculation and cost estimation per query
 Display cost and usage stats in the UI
 Allow saving queries to history (localStorage)
 Add ability to mark favorites or export history
Week 5: Security Improvements
 Research and implement basic client-side encryption for stored API keys
 Add a master password or passphrase input to encrypt/decrypt keys
 Test encryption workflow end-to-end
 Write user guide on how keys are secured
Week 6: Documentation & Launch Prep
 Write project README with clear goals, features, and setup instructions
 Add contributing guidelines and code of conduct
 Create issues and roadmap for next features
 Share the project on GitHub and relevant AI communities
Optional Follow-ups (Post-launch)
Implement auto-routing based on cost or latency
Build optional backend for sync or multi-device support
Add analytics dashboard for usage trends
Integrate more providers or plugins
